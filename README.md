# LLM-Assisted Application Evaluation at TUM

Welcome to the GitHub repository for our project "LLM-Assisted Application Evaluation at TUM". This project develops an intelligent assistant system for automating the evaluation of student applications for the masterâ€™s program at the Technical University of Munich (TUM). The system utilizes Large Language Models (LLMs) to analyze application documents (e.g., CVs, transcripts, motivation letters, essays) and generate structured recommendations that assist the selection committee in data-driven decision-making.
